My first repository
Hello world, I'm Sofi. I'm a physics student at the national autonomus university of mexico (UNAM). I love to code, and I'd like to learn to do it better, thatÂ´s why I'm taking an oline course on Data Science! In the course they've asked me to open a Git-Hub account, therefore here I am!
Hello world!
